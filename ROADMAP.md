Conductor: Core Roadmap
=======================

# 1.0.0
- Complete PHPUnit tests
- Add malukenho/docheader (See 
  https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-zendviewrenderer/blob/master/composer.json for example)
- Make an installer wizard that extends Zend Expressive's installer, but specific to Conductor
- Possibly make amphp/amphp optional and only add to composer suggest
